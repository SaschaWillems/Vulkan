# Getting the assets

Binary assets (models, textures, etc.) are not stored in this repository and need to be downloaded manually.

## Downloading the assets

### Option 1: Run the python script

Run the [download_assets.py](../download_assets.py) python script which will download the asset pack and unpacks it into the appropriate folder.

### Option 2: Manual download

Download the asset pack from [https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/downloads/vulkan_asset_pack_gltf.zip](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/downloads/vulkan_asset_pack_gltf.zip) and extract it in the ```data``` directory.
